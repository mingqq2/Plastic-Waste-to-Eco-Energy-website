            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
            Plastic waste pollution has been recognized a serious environmental issue. 
            In 2021, the global production of plastic waste reached 390.7 million metric tons, 
                with an annual growth rate of 4%. A recent report by the Organization for Economic 
                Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicates that 50% of plastic waste is dumped 
                into landfills, and 22% goes into in uncontrolled dumpsites. The accumulation 
                of non-degradable plastic waste in landfills has had harmful effects on ecosystems, 
                including the emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and pollution of land and 
                groundwater. Therefore, it is imperative to utilize the sustainable recycling techniques 
                to convert plastic waste into eco-energy, as it can reduce the negative environmental impact
                of plastic waste and harness the energy potential of plastics.
            </p>
            <p>
            Chemical recycling techniques degrade the hydrocarbon content of plastics into energy, fuels or other value-added chemicals. There are common techniques for plastic waste valorization, including traditional incineration, gasification, pyrolysis and depolymerization.

        <section id="Gasification">
            <h3>Gasification</h3>
            <p>
                Gasification has received particular attention for plastic waste thermochemical recycling treatment recently. 
                Gasification technique is possible to deal with a variety of solid waste, such as biomass, plastic, sewage sludge, crop residues, and industrial waste. One of the advantages for plastic waste gasification is the possibility of being able to treat heterogenous and contaminated polymers without too much pretreatment. 
            Compared with plastic incineration, gasification is more environmentally friendly as it operates at a lower temperature using a sub-stoichiometric amount of oxidant then produce a smaller quantity of pollutants, such as heavy metals, dioxins, furans and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are commonly released in incineration techniques.
                In gasification, plastic waste is reacted with gasifying agent at high temperature about 600 – 1000 °C to transform into a primarily gaseous output. Generally, the products of gasification are solid, liquid and gaseous, where solid may accounts for 30 – 50% of the input weight, liquid is combined with oil and tar, about 10 – 20% by weight of the input and gas yields ranged from 30 – 60%. 
                In most cases, gaseous or syngas is desirable products, mainly composed of H2, CO, CO2, N2 and some low molecular weight hydrocarbons, while tar and char are byproducts to be reduced. The key product syngas can be further used to produce downstream chemicals. 
            Gasification products otherwise are strongly influenced by the temperature, categories of plastics and gasifying agents. Considering the gasifying agents, the most investigated technologies including air gasification, steam gasification, CO2 gasification, and others innovative such as supercritical and plasma gasification.

        <section id="Incineration">
            <h3>Incineration</h3>
            <p>
                Incineration is a technique for thermal treatment of plastic waste or other municipal solid waste based on the application of high-temperature (870 °C – 1200 °C), which is usually integrated with heat recovery and power generation process. Incineration is a conventional alternative to deal with plastic waste with desirable economic benefits and possibility to commercialization. This waste-to-energy technique has considerable potential to witness steady growth in the coming years as the growth of plastics consumption. 
               One tone incineration of municipal waste generates about 1 metric ton of CO2, making significant greenhouse effect. The carbon intensity of European incinerators is 540 g CO2 eq per kWh, which is around twice the concentration of CO2 emissions derived from the average EU electricity grid (296 g CO2 eq per kWh) and obviously greater than the energy produced through conventional fossil fuels. Over its lifetime, a typical waste incinerator would release the equivalent of around 1.6 million metric tons of CO2 more than sending the same waste into landfill.

        <section id="Pyrolysis">
            <h3>Pyrolysis</h3>
            <p>
                Pyrolysis operates in the absence of oxygen and high temperature in the range of 300-1300 °C, degrading the plastic waste into gas, liquid oil, or wax under the effect of heat, which can be further refined into gasoline, diesel, and kerosene products. Typical types of reactors have been reported for plastic pyrolysis, including fluidized bed reactor, fixed bed reactor, and spouted bed reactor.
                According to the operating parameters such as heating rate, pyrolysis temperature, and residue time, conventional electric pyrolysis can be classified into three groups: slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, and flash pyrolysis.
                Flash pyrolysis is preferable when producing a liquid oil product, fast pyrolysis ranks second and finally is the slow pyrolysis. Other pyrolysis techniques such as catalytic pyrolysis, micro pyrolysis, vacuum pyrolysis, and hydro pyrolysis are also mentioned in literature. 
               The pyrolysis products relate directly to the chemical structure and mechanism of decomposition. For example, the reaction mechanism for the noncatalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene could be divided into four steps: a) free radical chain scission and hydrogen transfer to form olefins; b) chain termination after the hydrogen abstraction and β-scission; c) free radical chain termination to form long chain alkanes; d) chain scission followed by cyclization and dehydrogenation to form aromatics. It was also observed that the catalytic pyrolysis at 600 °C mainly formed alkanes, alkenes, and their branched derivatives. The thermal reaction had higher monomeric and oligomeric selectivity than the catalytic reaction and the addition of catalysts greatly influenced product compositions and selectivity of a specific compound. 
                When compared with the other thermochemical treatment technologies, pyrolysis has some outstanding advantages: 1) high yield of oil product; 2) the oil product is of high content of carbon, low impurities like nitrogen and sulfur, and high HHV; 3) short residence time in fast pyrolysis; 4) the desired product composition could vary by adjusting the operational parameters.

                As shown in the graph, plastic pieces are initially fed into the incinerator and react with air. 
                The exothermic reaction produces a stream of high-temperature flue gas, reaching up to 1000 °C. 
                To efficiently recover the substantial amount of heat contained in the flue gas, a heat exchanger 
                with water as working fluid is employed. Within the thermodynamic cycle, the heating process of water 
                can be categorized into three stages. The superheated steam is then directed into the steam turbine, 
                where it expands adiabatically with an isentropic efficiency, thereby propelling the impeller to generate 
                power. The wet steam exiting the steam turbine has low pressure and is subsequently condensed into saturated
                 water in a cooling tower. This saturated water is then pumped back into the boiler to restore to its initial 
                 state. The flue gas primarily consists of N2, excessive O2, H2O, and CO2. In line with sustainability considerations, 
                 CO2 is captured before being released into the atmosphere.

            <p>The captured CO2 is obtained from two sources: one is from the acid gas removal unit of syngas, 
                and the other is from the flue gas of gas turbine. The methanol synthesis reaction used in GFP-ME is 
                the same as that described in INP-ME, with the main difference being the quantity of feedstocks. Subsequently, 
                the raw methanol is sent to the methanol purification process, which involves a two-column separation process for 
                the removal of unreacted gas and the separation of water. The purified methanol, with a molar fraction exceeding 0.999, is then sold and contributes significantly to the process income.

            <p>A novel process has been developed to treat a mixture of waste materials, including forest residues,

                this study's conceptual process design innovatively integrates a rigorous water-gas shift reaction, heat recovery for power generation, 
                and carbon capture units. MDEA/PZ is selected as the solvent for capturing carbon and acid gases. In this process, carbon dioxide reacts with aqueous piperazine (PZ), forming carbamate (PZCOO-) 
                and dicarbamate (PZ(COO-)2) species. Simultaneously, methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) undergoes hydration to form MDEAH+. Following an additional pressure swing adsorption unit, blue hydrogen is produced. </p>

            <p>
                we have developed a qualitatively implicit knowledge-guided machine learning framework to improve plasma gasification process of plastic waste. This framework is adaptive to different machine learning techniques, exemplified by artificial neural network and support vector machine. The methodology is validated by a case study on the plasma gasification of medical plastic waste. The results found better generalizability and scientific interpretability in predicting syngas quality. The root mean square error and knowledge-based error were reduced by 36.44% and 83.22% compared to the traditional optimization framework, respectively. The proposed methodology successfully captures all desired implicit monotonicity relationships between syngas quality and feedstock characteristics/operating parameters, which addresses a limitation that traditional machine learning struggles with.

                Operations optimization for the plasma gasification process towards medical waste and biomass waste treatment was conducted based on genetic algorithm (GA) (see Figure 5). Given different blending amounts of biomass waste, three operating conditions, including gasification temperature (GT), steam-to-waste ratio (SWR), and equivalence ratio (ER), were considered during the optimization process to maximize the mole fraction of H2 in product gases. The analysis results of the case study showed the effectiveness of the optimization model, with an improvement in the H2 mole fraction by 10%.

                To optimize the system design, a multi-objective optimization framework has been introduced, aiming to minimize both the levelized cost of hydrogen and the endpoint lifecycle impact. A life cycle assessment, using a standard model, was established as one of the optimization objectives. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem, a combination of the ε-constraint method and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was employed, facilitating the search for optimal solutions. Based on the detailed systems modelling of the suggested conceptual design, two objectives have been defined: quantifying the levelized cost of hydrogen production and calculating the life cycle endpoint value using the standard life cycle impact assessment method, ReCiPe Endpoint. PSO algorithm was used to find the objective value for the process simulated in Aspen Plus. The multi-objective PSO algorithm was implemented in MATLAB platform and the simulator Aspen Plus was called by MATLAB using ActiveX automation server. Pareto curve shown in the graph illustrates the trade-offs between the economic and environmental objectives for the conceptual design.

                In this work, we first conducted a comprehensive feasibility analysis of three plastic waste valorisation processes. The sustainability metrics are quantified here from five aspects, which are environment, society, energy efficiency, economy, and safety. After the establishment of a comprehensive assessment framework, a multi-criteria decision-making tool based on the Bayesian best-worst weighting and vector-based ranking methods was proposed for prioritizing of the three valorisation pathways. The result found the gasification-based technology superior to incineration-based technology especially in economic, techno-energetic, and social aspects.

            <p>
                An energy-exergy-economic evaluation was conducted for the assessment of four plastic waste-to-wealth processes by considering energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and net present value. The investigated scenarios include INP-CC (incineration with carbon capture and power generation), GFP-CC (gasification with carbon capture and power generation), INP-ME (incineration with methanol and power cogeneration), and GFP-ME (gasification with methanol and power cogeneration). The behaviors of energy/exergy were illustrated by calculation analysis and flow diagram. According to the evaluation results, two gasification processes (GFP-CC and GFP-ME) show obvious advantages in energy efficiency (43.47%, 34.91%) over incineration technologies (INP-CC and INP-ME) with only 17.6% and 6.89%, respectively (see Figure 7). Nevertheless, the economic feasibility still needs to be further improved for process GFP-ME and INP-ME since these two scenarios have relatively high requirements on subsidy fee ($84 per ton) or higher methanol selling price ($550/t), and the payback period is still unsatisfactory (see Figure 8 and Figure 9). To further explore the influences of key economic parameters, sensitivity analysis was carried out and results indicated that the price of methanol and hydrogen has the greatest impact on process economic performance. Meanwhile, results also suggested that process INP-ME is more robust than GFP-ME when subjected to the same level of fluctuations in methanol and hydrogen prices.

                We conducted a comprehensive techno-economic and life cycle assessment for a plastic waste treatment process. The levelized cost of hydrogen product was selected to indicate the economic feasibility of the proposed system. Through the comparison with other costs of hydrogen production from different technologies, the economic feasibility of the proposed technique has been proven. The life cycle assessment was conducted based on the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards. Life cycle impact model ReCiPe 2016 Endpoint (H) v1.08 was used to estimate the environmental impact for mixed waste to blue hydrogen process. Under the three endpoint categories, a total of 22 sub-indicators was included. Normalization and weighting method World (2010) H/H were employed here for the aggregation progress to obtain one final value. Systems boundaries were defined in Figure 4. In comparison to the traditional steam methane reforming technique, the proposed hydrogen production process demonstrates superior performance across all endpoint indicators. It exhibits a significant reduction of 47.70% in human health impacts, 56.04% in ecosystem impacts, and 73.33% in resource impacts.
